                        <p class="raleway">The Henry M. Jackson High School (JHS) technology student association club is advised by Richard Wigre, who is a beloved teacher and mentor. Since the inception of the chapter, Jackson has actively encouraged and inspired students to explore the growing STEM fields: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. These students are able compete in events throughout the year including subjects such as: Webmaster, Promotional Graphics, or even On Demand Video. As the years pass, the JHS TSA chapter has grown and continues to gather the interest of the influx of incoming students in the Mill Creek area.
                        </p>
                        <p class="raleway"> Furthermore, our TSA chapter has collaborated with Jackson multiple times. For example, we are active participants in our school hosted Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest is a school run event in which clubs can set up booths to showcase their clubs. Taking advantage of photoshop and a green screen, we take a photo, edit it on site, and email it to the consumer. This photo booth has been very successful in the past and is a treat for Oktoberfest attendees. By showing off the ability of TSA club members in a fun and creative way, we spread awareness to our clubs' goals and practice their skills in a real world setting.

                        <p class="raleway">With the work of our advisor and hard working officers, the JHS TSA chapter has guided students to put their knowledge into various projects and activities. With their effort, students have discovered their love of the science and technology field while gaining valuable experiences and friendships. The goal of TSA is to expose students to the many opportunities in these fields, and by allowing students to participate in projects. Many are discovering their interests in subjects they may have never found anywhere else.</p>
